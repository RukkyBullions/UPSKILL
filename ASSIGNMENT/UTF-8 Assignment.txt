UTF-8 stands for “Unicode Transformation Format - 8 bits
UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format – 8-bit) it is a character encoding standard that is widely used in computing and communication systems. It is designed to represent and handle text in various languages and writing systems using a variable-length encoding scheme.

Here's why UTF-8 encoding is commonly used:

1. Universal Compatibility: UTF-8 is designed to be backward compatible with ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange), which means that any ASCII text is also valid UTF-8-encoded text. This makes it easy to work with existing systems and applications.

2. Multilingual Support: UTF-8 can represent virtually all characters from all human languages, including common scripts like Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and many others. This makes it a versatile choice for handling text in different languages.

3. Efficiency: UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding scheme, which means that it uses one to four bytes to represent a character, depending on its Unicode code point. This allows UTF-8 to be space-efficient while still accommodating a wide range of characters.

4. Widespread Adoption: UTF-8 has become the dominant character encoding standard on the web and in software development due to its flexibility, compatibility, and multilingual support. Most modern operating systems, programming languages, and web browsers support UTF-8 natively.

5. Interoperability: UTF-8 enables seamless communication and data exchange between systems and devices that may use different languages or character sets. It helps prevent issues like character corruption or misinterpretation when sharing text data across platforms.

Overall, UTF-8 encoding is preferred for its versatility, efficiency, compatibility, and broad adoption in the digital world. It plays a crucial role in enabling global communication, multilingual content creation, and cross-platform Interoperability.
